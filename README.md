# EXETER Selfbot

In order to use the bot, you need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Once that's installed, follow these steps.

## Step 1: Install dependencies.
You can do this by running the handy Install.exe file. It'll install the required dependencies and close automatically.

## Step 2: Configing.
Make your way to the data folder and open **cfg.json** in your preferred text editor. You need to replace the token in there with your own. [Here's a good tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI) on how to find your token.

## Step 3: Profit.
Once you're done with all that, run EXETER.exe to launch the bot. If you did everything correctly, the bot should show a splash screen and give you a warm welcome. Run -help to see a list of commands the bot is capable of.

# Q&A

Q: Why did you obfuscate your code?
A: I just want to avoid people cloning the repo and claiming it's theirs. Obfuscating makes that harder.

A: Well, if you're certain that you didn't fuck anything up, open an issue and I'll get back to you.

Q: can i hav tha sorce cod?????? plzzzzz???!!!!
